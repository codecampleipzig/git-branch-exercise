    <h1>git branching is hard</h1>
    <p>
      A branch represents an independent line of development. Branches serve as
      an abstraction for the edit/stage/commit process. You can think of them as
      a way to request a brand new working directory, staging area, and project
      history. New commits are recorded in the history for the current branch,
      which results in a fork in the history of the project.
    </p>
    <p>
      The git branch command lets you create, list, rename, and delete branches.
      It doesnâ€™t let you switch between branches or put a forked history back
      together again. For this reason, git branch is tightly integrated with the
      git checkout and git merge commands.
